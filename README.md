## Two Octave Quantized Controller for Eurorack

2Oct Ctrl is a two-octave, quantized DC controller for Eurorack. It will output 2 octaves of pitch CV using the 1v/oct standard and can quantize that CV to chromatic, major, or minor scales. It also includes a switch for changing the range from 0-2v to 1-3v, which can be used for an octave jump or for modules that don't track well below 1v. It is driven by a Teensy LC and uses the integrated 12-bit DAC for output. It only requires 5v power.
